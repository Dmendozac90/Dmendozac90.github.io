The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a powerful data-driven technique used to identify dynamical systems from high-dimensional data. Many complex dynamical systems evolve on a low-dimesnional attractor that may be characterized by spatiotemporal coherent structures. This method provides an *equation-free* way of decomposing a complex dynamical system into spatiotemporal coherent structures that may be used for future state prediction and control for a limited time.

The find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python%}
import numpy as np
print("hello")
for i in range(len(x)):
  slice = i
{% endhighlight%}

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np 
for i in range(len(x)):
  slice = i
print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
